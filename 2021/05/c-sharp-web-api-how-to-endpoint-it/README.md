## Project details

If you'd like to run the project, just issue the following command:

    docker-compose up app

Then, with `HTTPie`, you can call the endpoint through `http GET :8000/api/v1/movies`. To illustrate:

```shell
â–¶ http GET :8000/api/v1/movies
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Date: Wed, 26 May 2021 18:31:38 GMT

```
