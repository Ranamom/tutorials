# Auth0 Infrastructure

Didn't understand? Know [how Auth0 Deploy CLI works](https://www.willianantunes.com/blog/2022/02/getting-to-know-auth0-deploy-cli-with-a-practical-scenario/)!

Basically, this project configures your Auth0 tenant and retrieves its state to apply it in some environment files.

Look at the following files:

- [orchestrate.sh](./scripts/orchestrate.sh)
- [env_setter.py](./scripts/env_setter.py)

If you want to runt it, look at the [previous folder](./../README.md).
