# Redirect with Actions on Auth0 

This is working in progress.

Stay tuned!

## Running the project

Create an Auth0 tenant for you first; it's for free. So, replace the environment variables in the [Compose file](./docker-compose.yaml). Then, just run the following command:

    docker-compose up update-settings

Now you can run the following service:

    docker-compose up app
