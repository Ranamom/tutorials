## Running the project

Create an Auth0 tenant for your first; it's for free. So, replace the environment variables in the [Compose file](./docker-compose.yaml). Then just run the following command:

    docker-compose up update-settings

Then you can run the following services:

    docker-compose up django-api product-xyz
